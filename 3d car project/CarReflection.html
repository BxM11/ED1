	<h1>Car Reflection - 3D Printing</h1>

  <h2> Summary</h2>

	<p>The goal of this project was to create a replica
    of a matchbox car using 3d printing.  The replica was
    supposed to have a margin of error of <1%, and asthetically
    resemble the car we were supposed to be copying.  Along the
    way, we learned about the process of creating a digital 3d
    design.</p>

  <figcaption><i>The completed replica car (right), next to the original (left).</i></figcaption>

	<h2> Guidelines</h2>
	<p>These were the guidelines for the project:</p>

  <ul>
	<li>Car is designed as an intersection of 3 sketches</li>
  <li>Design car with 1:1 ratio of replica</li>
  <li>Size accuracy of +/- 1%</li>
  <li>Design is exported as a .stl</li>
  <li>File is exported as a .gcode to minimize support</li>
  <li>File design is shared out as an embedded .stl on a .html webpage</li>
	</ul>

  <h2>Process & Project Steps</h2>
  <p>Unlike the previous project, where I had alter the given project
  steps in order to make the design work, I basically followed the given
  steps for this project.  They were, in order:</p>

  <ol>
	<li>Chose a car to replicate, in my case a model Dodge Charger</li>
  <li>Join and learn how to use OnShape</li>
  <li>Create an engineering drawing of the car, which included:</li>
  <ul>
      <li>A side profile</li>
      <li>A front profile</li>
      <li>A top profile</li>
      <li>An orthogonal drawing of the car</li>
      <li>Measurements of each of the car's dimensions, measured with calipers</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Create a rectangular prism in onshape, and import the drawings of the sides to create a 3D envelope</li>
  <li>Copy the imported images into an OnShape sketch</li>
  <li>Remove the negative spaces left on the outside of the drawings</li>
  <li>Add fillets and any extras which couldn't be modelled in before</li>
  <li>Export the .stl file from OnShape to Cura, where it is sliced to prepare for printing</li>
  <li>After slicing, export to printer as a .gcode file for printing</li>
  </ol>

  <h2> Setbacks & Solutions</h2>

  <p>At the beginning of the project, we tried to use Fusion 360 for the project, but it had enough
    security measures to keep out real users, so we couldn't use it, which was the first seback.
    For most of the rest of of the project, I didn't have many significant setbacks.  Most of the process
    just worked as intended.  However, I did have some minor problems.  The first was my lack of drawing,
    skill, so I unsurprisingly produced an engineering drawing that had fairly inaccurate proportions.
    Because there was no "direct to digitial" option for this project like there has been for most of the
    other projects' designs, I had to live with my inaccurate drawing, which inevitably produced a 3d envelope
    whose sides simply didn't fit properly together on the box which they were supposed to fit on.</p>

  <img class = "center" src = "3d car/Original Envelope.png" alt = "envelope" style = "width: 40%">
  <figcaption><i>The blue rectangle is the size that the sketches were supposed to be.  As you can see, I missed by quite a ways</i></figcaption>

  <p>Fortunately, the car still looked the way it was supposed to.  Because I didn't have a way to fix the
    drawings, or a way to make them more accurate, I just continued on, copying over the images into OnShape.
    sketches. When finished, I just rescaled my sketches so that they fit each other, and kept going with the project.</p>

  <img class = "center" src = "3d car/OnShape Sketches.png" alt = "sketches" style = "width: 40%">
  <figcaption><center><i>The envelope, with onshape sketches, after being rescaled</i></center></figcaption>

  <p>Another problem I had was when I tried to round the corners of my car in OnShape.  I had just
    assumed that OnShape could just make a rounded corner with whatever radius, and if it didn't fit it would
    just maximize the possible radius, or just chop off part of the circle used to make the radius to make it fit.
    I was surprised, therefore, when I OnShape kept insisting that it couldn't resolve the sketch when I tried adding
    radii much larger than were possible in the space provided.  Fortunately, the sketches resolved when I lowered the radius,
    except for one part at the back that was tied into too many non-rounded corners and simply wouldn't resolve, so I
    just left it.  The final problem was when I tried to print my car.  The printing surface on the 3d printer was dirty, so
    the fillament didn't stick to the printing plate.  This was fixed by removing and cleaning the plate, then starting
    the print again.  Luckily, there was nothing wrong with the design, and the car printed as it should have.  My
    only self-criticism is that the margin of error was way above 1%, and over 10% on the x-axis.  Clearly, I didn't
    meet the stated goal of 1% error, but I don't know how much I could have done about that, since that part relied
    on drawing.</p>

  <p>Disclaimer: The mechanism for using the div method and box class to make the images into a grid, used here,
    was heavily based on the w3 schools tutorial code - I figured out how it worked but am still fairly unclear on the mechanics here; this isn't
    my code and I don't want to take credit for it</p>
